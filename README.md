# chat-example

This repo is based in the source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

Ideas to implement as soon as I can:
- [ ] Add code conventions to readme file 
- [ ] Implement husky to validate commit messages rules
- [ ] Implement CI workflow
- [ ] Implement CD workflow
- [ ] Deploy in a real environment
- [ ] Add username and 'is typing' information according this [reference](https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-11-a-starter-guide-to-building-real-time-applications-with-nodejs/)
- [ ] Replace jquery dependency for a new strategy
- [ ] Define how to make a distribuited version
- [ ] Define next steps
